Describe the StatefulSet:

This command provides details about the stateful set, its conditions, and events which might hint at what went wrong.

```bash
microk8s kubectl describe statefulset postgres
```

Get the pods:
This command lists the pods associated with the PostgreSQL deployment. It will help identify if the pod is running, pending, or in a crash loop.

```bash
microk8s kubectl get pods -l app=postgres
```

Describe the Pod:
If you find any issues with the pod (e.g., it's in a CrashLoopBackOff state), you can describe it to get more details about its conditions and events.

```bash
microk8s kubectl describe pod postgres-0
```

Check the logs:
If the init container or main container has issues, you can check their logs.

For the main PostgreSQL container:

```bash
microk8s kubectl logs postgres-0
```

For the init-db container:

```bash
microk8s kubectl logs postgres-0 -c init-db
```

Check Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):
This will show if your persistent volume claim for PostgreSQL data was successfully bound to a Persistent Volume.

```bash
microk8s kubectl get pvc
```

Check Services:
To ensure your service is set up and running correctly:

```bash
microk8s kubectl get svc postgres
```

Start by running these commands sequentially, and they will likely give you insights into what might be causing the issue. If you share the outputs, I can help further diagnose the problem
